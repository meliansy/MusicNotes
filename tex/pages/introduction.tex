The way students are are taught Music differs from school to school. In Dunman High, the main differences are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For Western Art Music, focus composers are \textbf{Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven}. Other schools teach on composers such as Stamitz and Schubert, and it may be worth the reader's time to independently student other contemporaries.
    \item For Asian Music, Dunman High focuses on \textbf{Malay Music and Indian Music}. Other schools cover Chinese String Music more thoroughly, but it is not necessary to cover all Asian Music topics.
    \item It is obligatory to take H3 Music in Dunman High School. H3 Music is a research paper that does not count to the UAS score and is not a compulsory subject to be taken.
\end{itemize}
