    \chapter*{Preface}
    Firstly, I would like to thank the music department at Dunman High School, specifically \textbf{Mrs Debbie Han} and \textbf{Ms Yick Jue Ru} for their guidance in the subject.
    
    This book is a compilation \thanks{Notes are not endorsed by the school.} of notes and music analyses based on the Dunman High School A Level Music curriculum 2024-2025, which is modeled after the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A Level \href{https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2025/9753_y25_sy.pdf}{Syllabus 9753 (H2 Music)} and \href{https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2025/9819_y25_sy.pdf}{Syllabus 9819 (H3 Music)}. The following notes will mainly cover content for the Music Studies paper. Note that the syllabus for Western Classical Music changes in 2026, and that H3 Music may not be taken by all MEP branches. 
    
    \noindent Candidates will have to take 4 papers as part of the H2 Music curriculum, namely:
